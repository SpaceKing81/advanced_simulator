# Advanced Simulator

Advanced Complicated Physics simulator

Of-shoot of the brain project, I was trying to make the display dynamic and move based on the connections while not collapsing into a center. Basiclly what I ended up doing was making each axion a spring and each neuron an electic particle, and make an invisible spring tied to every neuron in the center of the screen. The mechanics I set up seemed very simple, and I thought to myself to build a dedicated physics simulator. Just for the hell of it, because I already had most of the logic and troubleshooting done already. Right? Nope...

Maybe I am a perfectionist, or maybe I just have an overactive imagination. No, I'm just a perfecitonist, and probably a masochist. I was going for a nice, easy, simple physics simulation, and then I took a shower and pondered how they built a computer in minecraft that could play minecraft. And, using a completly logical line of reasoning, decided that I needed to make my physics simulator as realistic as possible

I then tried to add in as few simple apspects to a partical as possible, and intend to have the only interactions be through the electric, gravitaional, and maybe strong force, and have the thing be scalable, so that you can click a magnifiying glass and alter the projected sizes of particals based on mass to simulate getting bigger and smaller


Goals:
- Simulation that depicts acuratly the 4 fundemntal forces
- Eventually move towards a layered field approch, mimicing the ideas of QFT while maintaing the onmipotant advantages of a computer
- Accurate motion, conservation, and entropic emergence
- Eventually, the whole thing will be realistic enough for me to simulate the big bang as if the universe started as a 0 dimentional point with all the energy in that point
